# Design Patterns - A Guide to Learning the Classics
This `README.md` was made for you, so I suggest starting to read it to guide and navigate you through all the contents and code in this guide.

## Preface
>Since I had to start a new project in my job, I began to think about the best practices to transform my project into a good boilerplate to inspire future projects of the squad that I'm part of. Because of this, I decided to learn all 22 classic design patterns with my friend and coworker [Viniciusalves16](https://github.com/Viniciusalves16). So, here are all of our annotations that we learned about design patterns using Java as our programming language to implement them. Hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š
